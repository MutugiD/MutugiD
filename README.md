ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

Iâ€™m Mutugi Nkonge. I'm a data scientist with 4+ years of hands on experience. I have great enthusiasm for leveraging creativity, 
programming and data skills to engineer solutions. I combine my knowledge of software and data science to build data-driven
and products that can solve problems and derive insights from the customers. 

Iâ€™m interested in computational finance and data science projects. 

Strong languages - Python and its derivatives - Keras, Tensorflow and PyTorch. 

ðŸŒ± Currently learning and experimenting Deep Learning Models, MLOPs, and end-to-end pipeline developments.
