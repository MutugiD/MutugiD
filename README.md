👋 Hi there, 

I’m Mutugi D Nkonge. I'm a data scientist and a ML developer. I have great enthusiasm for leveraging creativity, 
programming and data skills to engineer solutions. I combine my knowledge of software and data science to build data-driven
and products that can solve problems and derive insights from the customers. 

I’m interested in data anaytics, data science and ML projects. 

Strong languages: Python and its derivatives- Tensorflow and PyTorch. 

🌱 Currently learning Deep Generative Models (Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and Normalizing Flows  (NFs)), MLOPs, and end-to-end pipeline developments. 

💞️ Collaborate on various data-driven projects, in diverse industries.
